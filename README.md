# Python

## Cryptocalc
I don't know if I did this correctly. My maths are a bit shady, so don't depend on it too much

## Dieroll
Rolls an amount of dice. Whatever you want. Flexible.

## Guess
A fun guess the number game.

## Lucky
Enter a search term, and it'll pull up the top five results in your default browser. Cool, huh?

## Scraper
Just a really simple, quick and dirty web scraper to download some stuff. I might combine it with the lucky program to be cooler. Who knows?
